# Unification roadmap (Bash / PowerShell → Go)

Replace dual-shell maintenance with one **Go** CLI while keeping **full feature
and test parity** on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

| Doc | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [unification-audit.md](unification-audit.md) | Inventory + detailed parity matrix |
| [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](../spec/cli-contract.yaml) | Machine-readable commands / flags |
| [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) | Shipped slice notes |
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Dev setup (`make build`, `make test-go`) |

## Status at a glance

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Spec + gate** | Done | Contract + `make check-cli-contract` in lint |
| **1 — MVP strangler** | Done | `go/` Cobra dispatcher + legacy exec |
| **2 — Config + read-mostly** | Done | `schedule config`, `theme list`, bare diag |
| **3 — Mutating core** | Done | Upgrade/repair/purge/diag (incl. follow) native |
| **4 — Schedule + installers** | Done | Schedule + installers Go-first; legacy dual-scope systemd cleanup (4m) |
| **5 — MCP + cleanup** | Done | Native Go MCP + `--register` + PATH twin; Python escape hatch remains |
| **6 — Graduation** | In progress | 6a–6b: meta + schedule config graduated (dual-OS Go CI); dual libs still present |

Force any native path back to shell/PS: `MILLENNIUM_LEGACY=1`.

`make build` → `bin/millennium`. Unix `install.sh` and Windows `install.ps1`
prefer that Go binary for PATH `millennium` / `millennium.exe` (shell/PS
fallback). Release CD embeds per-OS/arch Go binaries and versioned archives;
builds wait on a green required-CI gate before packaging assets.

---

## How to read progress

| Mark | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Done | Native Go path for this surface (may still fall back to legacy on some OS/euid cases) |
| Graduated | Native Go + dual-OS CI gate; legacy may remain until a later peel-off PR |
| Partial | Native for dry-run / some OS / some flags; live or other OS still legacy |
| Legacy | Still Bash / PowerShell / Python |
| Blocked | Waiting on another slice (elevation, packaging, or dual-OS CI) |

**Graduation** (delete legacy for command *C*) is stricter than “native exists” —
see [Command graduation rule](#command-graduation-rule). Rows marked Done here
are strangler progress, not automatic permission to delete `.sh` / `.ps1`.

## Next up (recommended order)

Work through this queue; check items off as PRs land and update this list.

1. [x] **Windows + packaging Go-first** — `install.ps1` prefers `.exe`; versioned OS/arch release assets; from-source / `-bin` / `-git` matrix (+ deb/rpm/Chocolatey); release CD gated on green CI
2. [x] **Doctor / purge / uninstall: dual systemd scopes** — Phase 4m; legacy Bash + `install.sh` clean system **and** user units
3. [x] **MCP prefer Go for non-elevate** — Phase 5a; Python façade → `millennium <cmd>` when present
4. [x] **MCP elevate via Go + sudoers** — Phase 5b; verb-restricted sudoers; MCP elevates Go dispatcher
5. [x] **Native Go MCP server (5c.1)** — `millennium mcp` owns stdio JSON-RPC; Python prefer-exec + `--register`
6. [x] **Go MCP `--register` + packaging entry** — Phase 5c; PATH `millennium-mcp` = Go argv0 twin; Python lib escape hatch
7. [x] **Phase 6a dual-OS graduation gate** — `check-all` → `test-go`; `go.yml` Windows+Linux dispatcher smokes; meta surface graduated
8. [x] **Phase 6b schedule config graduated** — dual-OS `go.yml` set/get/list smoke; dual libs kept until peel
9. [x] **Phase 6c schedule config peel** — long-name `config` thin-wraps to Go; `schedule_config.sh` / `ScheduleConfig.ps1` removed
10. [ ] **Graduate remaining commands** — dual-OS Go coverage + delete dual libs per [graduation rule](#command-graduation-rule), command-by-command

## Phases (detail)

### Phase 0 — Spec + gate — Done

- [x] [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](../spec/cli-contract.yaml)
- [x] [`scripts/ci/check-cli-contract.py`](../scripts/ci/check-cli-contract.py)
- [x] Wired into `make lint`

### Phase 1 — MVP strangler — Done

- [x] Go module under [`go/`](../go/)
- [x] Native version / help / suggestions
- [x] Other commands exec legacy (`internal/legacy`)
- [x] `make build` / `make test-go` / CI workflow

### Phase 2 — Config + read-mostly — Done

- [x] `schedule config` get/set/list
- [x] `theme list` (+ `--json`)
- [x] Bare / quiet `diag` summary

### Phase 3 — Mutating core — Done

Exit when upgrade / repair / purge / doctor are natively usable on both OSes
with `MILLENNIUM_LEGACY=1` only as escape hatch.

- [x] Upgrade: rollback list/apply, dry-run, download+SHA, install when writable
- [x] Upgrade: non-root Linux system install / rollback via `sudo` handoff
- [x] Purge: dry-run + Unix live + Windows live
- [x] Repair: dry-run + user-path live
- [x] Diag: `--json`, `--share`, `logs`, doctor dry-run + live, `--follow`

### Phase 4 — Schedule + installers — Done

- [x] Schedule status + Unix enable/disable (+ dry-run everywhere)
- [x] Linux **system** + **user** systemd service/timer (prefer system; `--system` / `--user`; migrate other scope)
- [x] Theme install/update/remove (companion slice)
- [x] Windows schedule enable/disable live (Task Scheduler)
- [x] `pre-update` / `post-update` (Unix/macOS; Steam capture/close/relaunch + diag)
- [x] `schedule setup` wizard → native enable (honors `--system` / `--user` / `--cron`)
- [x] Unix `install.sh` Go-first PATH `millennium` (`make build` / prebuilt; shell fallback)
- [x] Windows `install.ps1` prefers `millennium.exe`; release CD embeds Go in versioned OS/arch archives
- [x] Packaging matrix: from-source / `-bin` / `-git` (+ deb/rpm/Chocolatey recipes)
- [x] **Phase 4m:** Doctor / purge / uninstall clean **both** systemd scopes on legacy Bash paths (`disable_timer`, `install.sh` uninstall without `runuser` privilege drop, purge prefers `millennium schedule disable`); diag detects system timers

### Systemd system vs user

Linux when systemd is available (non-`--cron`):

| Preference | When |
| --- | --- |
| **System** (`/etc/systemd/system`, `systemctl` without `--user`) | Preferred when this process can write system units (typically root). Avoids linger for headless updates. |
| **User** (`~/.config/systemd/user`, `systemctl --user`) | Fallback when system units are unavailable. Linger tip still printed. |

Shipped behavior:

1. **Selection:** auto prefers system; `--system` / `--user` force; mutual exclusion.
2. **Units:** `millennium-update.service` / `.timer`; system scope sets `User=` / `Group=` / `HOME=` from `SUDO_USER` (or current user).
3. **Status / disable (Go):** probe and clear both scopes (system skip if unprivileged).
4. **Enable (Go):** removes the other scope when possible before writing.
5. **Legacy Bash:** `disable` / enable-migration / uninstall clear both scopes; Bash enable still writes user units until graduated.
6. **macOS / Windows / cron:** unchanged.

### Phase 5 — MCP + cleanup — Done

- [x] **Phase 5a:** Python MCP prefers Go `millennium <feature>` for non-elevating tools; `MILLENNIUM_MCP_LONGNAMES=1` escape
- [x] **Phase 5b:** Sudoers (install.sh + Arch) allowlist Go `millennium {upgrade,diag,repair,purge}[ *]` plus long-names; MCP elevates via Go; Windows RunAs for `.exe`
- [x] **Phase 5c.1:** Native Go MCP stdio (`millennium mcp`); Python prefer-execs Go (skip under `TEST_SUITE_RUN` / `MILLENNIUM_MCP_PYTHON=1`)
- [x] **Phase 5c:** Go `--register`; PATH `millennium-mcp` installs Go argv0 twin (shim fallback); Python kept as lib escape hatch; Windows `.cmd` → `millennium.exe mcp`

### Phase 6 — Graduation — In progress

- [x] **Phase 6a:** `make check-all` → `lint` + `test-go` + `test`; `go.yml` dual-OS dispatcher smokes (version/help/suggest); Linux-only legacy help smoke retained; CONTRIBUTING parity gate documents Go CI for graduated surfaces
- [x] **Phase 6b:** `schedule config` get/set/list dual-OS Go smoke + graduated mark; `schedule_config.sh` / `ScheduleConfig.ps1` kept for long-name helpers until peel
- [x] **Phase 6c:** Peel schedule-config dual libs — long-name `config` → `millennium schedule config` (`MILLENNIUM_LEGACY=0`); delete Bash/PS config libs; CI builds Go for schedule/MCP suites
- [ ] Graduate remaining commands command-by-command (dual-OS Go coverage, then peel dual libs)
- [ ] Every contract feature implemented **once** in Go
- [ ] Every [parity matrix](unification-audit.md#parity-matrix) row green / graduated
- [ ] Bash / Pester suites retired only after Go dual-OS suite supersedes them
- [ ] Dual libs removable after per-command graduation

---

## Command graduation rule

Do **not** remove or stop testing a legacy `.sh` / `.ps1` path for command *C*
until all of the following are true:

1. Go implements *C* with feature parity per [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](../spec/cli-contract.yaml).
2. Automated tests for *C* run and pass on **both** Linux and Windows in CI
   (shared table-driven Go tests and/or dual-OS behavioral jobs).
3. MCP, completions, and man pages (where applicable) describe the Go surface.
4. The audit [parity matrix](unification-audit.md#parity-matrix) row for *C* is
   updated to green.

Keep Bash + Pester green for unmigrated commands. Supersede suites
**command-by-command** — do not rewrite everything in one PR.

### PR checklist (migrating a command)

- [ ] Contract updated first (if flags/subcommands change)
- [ ] Go implementation + dual-OS tests
- [ ] Legacy scripts still present until graduation (or still tested)
- [ ] This roadmap progress tables updated
- [ ] Parity matrix row updated in [unification-audit.md](unification-audit.md)
- [ ] Completions / man / MCP updated if the user surface changed
- [ ] CHANGELOG note for the slice

---

## Parity policy

- User-facing features match across supported OSes.
- OS-shaped *implementations* (systemd vs Task Scheduler, sudoers vs UAC) are
  adapters, not product forks.
- Silent gaps are forbidden. Contract-marked **OS-only** knobs (e.g.
  `schedule --cron`) are the only exceptions — see the audit.

---

## Test parity (end-state)

| Layer | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Contract / static | `check-cli-contract` aligns MCP, completions, man, Go registration |
| Unit | Table-driven Go tests; OS packages use tags/skips only for OS APIs |
| Behavioral | Help / dry-run / happy / failure per command on **linux** and **windows** CI |
| Packaging | Install smokes stay green for Go-first assets on both platforms |
| Coverage gate | Before deleting legacy tests for *C*, Go coverage for *C* must replace them |

---

## Key artifacts

| Artifact | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`spec/cli-contract.yaml`](../spec/cli-contract.yaml) | Source of truth for commands / flags / platforms |
| [`scripts/ci/check-cli-contract.py`](../scripts/ci/check-cli-contract.py) | Drift gate |
| [`go/`](../go/) | Strangler CLI (`cmd/millennium` + `internal/*`) |
| `make build` / `make test-go` / `make check-all` / `make check-cli-contract` | Local DX (`check-all` = lint + test-go + test) |
